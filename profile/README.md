## Hi there 👋
This is the one true source of knowledge for MHacks 17. Not the Slack, not a text from Kevin or Harry-- here. We'll update the docs in the Docs repo and in the Wiki! This is super exciting stuff, looking forward to working on it with you all. 


<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
